        <p className='text-2xl mx-10 font-serif'>We come together to encourage discussions of exploring white identity in the context of racism in America. With that foundation we learn about the characteristics of white supremacy culture and lean into antidotes as we strengthen an anti-racist community. The ultimate goal is to help us fully understand our stakes in dismantling racism and why it is important to be invested in this ongoing work.</p>
