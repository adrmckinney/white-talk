    paragraph1: 'Privilege is a power that takes intentionality to see, and it is necessary that we see it in order to reduce harm moving forward. One thing that I have learned over the years is that to be a better anti-racist, one must make mistakes and be grounded in their own understanding as race and racism continues to evolve and change in itâ€™s presentation. I have also witnessed that the best anti-racists do not operate in a vacuum; that it takes the strength of a community to come together and support each other on this journey.',
    paragraph2: 'Lastly, I decided to focus my energy toward creating intentional white spaces because I have found it invaluable to be able to collectively process what it means to be white in this country, especially without harming our friends and family of color. I recognize that meeting solely in white spaces has limitations to accomplishing racial liberation; yet racial liberation cannot be realized without us working collectively as white people to more fully understand what it means to be white and anti-racist. Without this intentional commitment for collective learning and growth, we will be unprepared to do anti-racist work, not seeing the whiteness we carry with us, not knowing what role we are supposed to play, not realizing that our good intentions might be causing harm.',
